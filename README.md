# youtube-clone
Iâ€™m excited to share my simple YouTube clone project! This experience allowed me to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface and implementing interactive features, which deepened my understanding of front-end development. I look forward to building on this foundation in future projects!
